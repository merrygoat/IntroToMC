# Introduction Python

This tutorial was originally developed in 2016 for a graduate course in Simulation Methods for the Bristol Centre for Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol. The Course heavily modified for 2017, restricting the scope to teaching basic Python. This material was created and taught by Peter Crowther.

The tutorial assumes understanding of basic scientific and programming concepts but no previous programming experience.
