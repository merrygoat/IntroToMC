This tutorial was prepared for a 10 hour graduate course in Simulation Methods for the Bristol Centre for Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol. The Course was first delivered in November 2016. This document is not the complete course but comprises most of the interactive material. This material was created by Peter Crowther. Joshua Robinson proof read the tutorial and created supporting MD code (available separately). The course was taught by Dr Paddy Royall while Peter and Joshua were teaching assistants.

The tutorial assumes understanding of basic scientific and programming concepts but no previous programming experience.
